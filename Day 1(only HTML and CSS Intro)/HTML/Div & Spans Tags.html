        <h1>Div Tag And Span Tag Use in HTML</h1>
        <div>This is a simple Div tag which makes a division of the page available or a section is created using this tag</div>
        <br>Now We moved to next line using the <u>br</u> tag<br>
        <br>
        Now we will use Span tag to make it clear to you :)<br>
        <p>So this is the start of a paragraph <u>p</u> tag to make a paragraph wherein which we will be using use of "span" tag<br>
        so this is not in a span but <span><strong>this is along with the use of <u>strong</u> tag</strong>this is</span></p>
